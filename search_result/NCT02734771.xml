    <textblock>
      This is a study incorporating brentuximab vedotin and dose attenuated rituximab,
      cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) into initial therapy for elderly
      patients with DLBCL. Vincristine will be omitted from the standard R-CHOP regimen given the
      overlapping toxicities with brentuximab vedotin.

      This is a multicenter, single-arm pilot study incorporating brentuximab vedotin and dose
      attenuated rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (R-CHP) into initial
      therapy for elderly patients with DLBCL. Vincristine will be omitted from the standard R-CHOP
      regimen given the overlapping toxicities with brentuximab vedotin. CD30 positivity will be
      determined at enrollment and patients will be enrolled into a CD30 positive and negative
      group in equal numbers. Additionally, a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) will be
      performed on all patients, but this will not be used to guide treatment decisions.

    <description>Per the Lugano Criteria, progression is defined as an individual node/lesion that increases in size by 50% or in the setting of splenomegaly, the splenic length must increase by 50% of the extent of its prior increase beyond baseline (eg, a 15-cm spleen must increase to 16 cm). If no prior splenomegaly, must increase by at least 2 cm from baseline or any new or recurrent splenomegaly or new o
