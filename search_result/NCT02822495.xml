      The primary objective of this protocol is to provide expanded access to tabelecleucel to
      patients with Epstein-Barr virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder
      (EBV+ PTLD), EBV+ primary immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disease (EBV+ PID
      LPD), EBV+ acquired immunodeficiency-associated LPD (EBV+ AID LPD), EBV+ leiomyosarcoma (EBV+
      LMS), or EBV viremia, for whom there are no other appropriate therapeutic options, and who
      are not eligible to enroll in clinical studies designed to support the development and
      registration of tabelecleucel.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Any of the following diagnoses of EBV+ malignancies or disease:

               1. EBV+ PTLD following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT)

               2. EBV+ PTLD following solid organ transplant (SOT)

               3. Persistent EBV viremia and known or suspected immunodeficiency

               4. EBV+ LPD that has developed in the setting of an AID

               5. EBV+ LPD that has developed in the setting of a known or suspected PID

               6. EBV+ LMS

          2. Any of the following evidence of EBV positivity:

               1. Biopsy showing EBV+ disease

               2. A combination of circulating EBV DNA and radiographic appearance consistent with
                  an EBV+ malignancy (if biopsy is not clinically feasible in the opinion of the
                  treating physician)

               3. For patients with EBV viremia only: 2 serial serum EBV DNA assays performed at
                  least 4 weeks apart showing detectable EBV viremia

          3. Relapsed or refractory disease, defined as failure to achieve response (ie, complete
             response [CR] or partial response [PR]) or recurrence of disease following first line
             therapy, ie, systemic therapy for EBV-related malignancy or viremia that includes an
             anti-CD20 antibody, except in subjects with CD20 negative disease. Reduction of
             immunosuppression will not be considered as first-line therapy. Patients with CD20+
             PTLD following SOT must have failed anti-CD20 antibody therapy plus an additional
             systemic therapeutic agent, typically chemotherapy. Patients with CD20 negative PTLD
             must have failed first-line chemotherapy.

          4. Not eligible for any other study supporting clinical development of tabelecleucel

          5. For patients with PTLD in the allogeneic HCT setting, the underlying disease for which
             allogeneic HCT was performed is in morphologic remission

          6. Adequate organ function per the following:

               1. Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/μL, with or without cytokine support

               2. Platelet count ≥ 20,000/μL, with or without transfusion support

          7. Patient or patient's representative is willing and able to provide written informed
             consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Current diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma, classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, or any T-cell
             lymphoma

          2. Prior treatment with any investigational product within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1, or
             within 5 half-lives from the most recent dose to Cycle 1 Day 1

          3. Ongoing need for methotrexate or extracorporeal photopheresis; steroid doses &gt; 1
             mg/kg/day of prednisone (or equivalent)

          4. Need for vasopressor or ventilatory support, unless deemed to be caused by the
             EBV-driven process that tabelecleucel is intended to treat

          5. Antithymocyte globulin, alemtuzumab, or similar anti-T-cell antibody therapy, or
             T-cell immunotherapy (donor lymphocyte infusion, other CTLs) ≤ 4 weeks prior to Cycle
             1 Day 1

          6. Pregnancy

          7. Female of childbearing potential or male with a female partner of childbearing
             potential, either of whom are unwilling to use a highly effective method of
             contraception
