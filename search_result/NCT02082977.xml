  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) for GSK2816126 given twice weekly by intravenous (IV) infusion. Part 1 will be
      conducted in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL),
      transformed follicular lymphoma (tFL), other Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL), solid tumors
      (including castrate resistant prostate cancer) and multiple myeloma (MM) to determine the
      safety and tolerability of GSK2816126. Expansion cohorts (Part 2) are planned to further
      explore clinical activity of GSK2816126 at the RP2D in subjects with Enhancer of Zeste 2
      (EZH2) wild type and EZH2 mutant positive germinal center B-cell like diffuse large B cell
      lymphoma (GCB-DLBCL), tFL and MM.

    <description>Blood samples were collected for evaluation of clinical chemistry parameters including direct bilirubin, chloride, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein, urea/blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid. Baseline value was defined as the most recent, non-missing value from a local laboratory prior to the first dose of study treatment. Change from Baseline was defined as any visit value minus Baseline value. The summaries of worst case change from Baseline with respect to normal range have been presented for only those laboratory tests that are not gradable by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. The number of participants with decreases to low, changes to normal or no changes from Baseline, and increases to high values have been presented. Only those participants with data available at the specified data points were analyzed (represented by n= X in the category titles).</description>
