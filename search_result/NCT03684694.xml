      The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of
      Loncastuximab Tesirine (ADCT-402) and Ibrutinib in patients with Advanced Diffuse Large
      B-Cell Lymphoma or Mantle Cell Lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, single-arm combination study with a dose escalation phase
      (Part 1) followed by a dose expansion phase (Part 2). The study will enroll approximately 60
      patients.

      A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used for Part 1. The DLT period will be the 21
      days following the first dose of ibrutinib. The initial dose escalation cohort will receive
      loncastuximab tesirine for 2 cycles with concurrent ibrutinib (concomitant therapy) and may
      then continue ibrutinib therapy up to one year. Depending on the safety and tolerability of
      loncastuximab tesirine given concurrently with ibrutinib in the initial cohort, subsequent
      cohorts may receive either loncastuximab tesirine with concurrent ibrutinib or loncastuximab
      tesirine followed by ibrutinib (sequential therapy).

      Patients who have a response of PR or stable disease (SD) at the 14-week assessment may
      receive two additional doses of loncastuximab tesirine given 4 weeks apart.

      Part 2 will consist of up to two expansion cohorts, one for DLBCL and one for MCL. Each
      cohort will be 20 patients treated at the dose determined in Part 1.

      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of 3
      to 4 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week visits for up to 2 years
      after treatment discontinuation).
