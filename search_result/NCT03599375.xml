      This study aims to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of CD19 Chimeric Antigen
      Receptor (CAR) redirected autologous T-cells in treating patients with recurrent or
      refractory CD19 positive B cell ccute lymphoblastic leukemia,and dynamically observe the
      changes of CAR-T in patients and the residual tumor.

    <textblock>
      In this single-center, open-label, single-arm, prospective clinical trial, a total of 20
      recurrent or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients will be
      enrolled.After recruiting eligible patients,autologous peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells(PBMCs) will be purified from whole blood.The CD3+ T cells were subsequently selected
      and re-stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies.T cells will be transduced
      with lentiviral vector for the generation of the CD19 CART cell and administered by i.v.
      injection.The purpose of current study is to determine the safety and clinical efficacy of
      CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with recurrent or refractory CD19+ ALL.

    <description>The qualified CD19-targeted CART cells will be transferred to patient for 3 days as follow:D1,10% fraction;D2,30%;D3 60%. The number of CART cells for each course will be about 1×106/kg. If complete response (CR) or complete response with incomplete hemogram recovery (CRi) in hemogram is achieved after the first course of treatment, further treatment will be decided according to the clinical assessment and the wishes of the patient.If partial response (PR) is achieved after the first course, 1 or 2 courses of treatment will be continued. If there is no response (NR) after the first course, the treatment will be ceased or restarted based on the clinical assessment or patients' wishes. Treatent may be discontinued due to any severe toxicity, such as cytokine release syndrom.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1.Recurrent or refractory B cell derived acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL). 2.Patients
             who have failed at least one line of a standard treatment without effective treatment
             measures at present.

             3.CD19 expression on the surface of B-ALL cells must be detected by immunophenotyping.

             4.KPS&gt;80. 5.Life expectancy&gt;3 months. 6.Patients must have adequate cardiac
             function(no electrocardiogram with obvious abnormality, LVEF≥50%),adequate pulmonary
             function as indicated by room air oxygen saturation of &gt;90%, and adequate renal
             function(Cr≤2.5 times of the normal range).

             7.The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the glutamic oxaline aminotransferase (AST)≤
             3 times of the normal range, and the total bilirubin (TBIL)≤2.0mg/dl (34.2umol/L).
