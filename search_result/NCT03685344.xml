      The purpose of this Phase 1 study is to evaluate the safety and antitumor activity of
      Loncastuximab Tesirine (ADCT-402) and Durvalumab in Patients with Advanced Diffuse Large
      B-Cell Lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, or Follicular Lymphoma

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b, open-label, single-arm combination study with a dose escalation phase
      (Part 1) followed by a dose expansion phase (Part 2). The study will enroll approximately 75
      patients.

      A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used for Part 1. The DLT period will be the 21
      days after the first durvalumab dose.

      Part 2 will consist of up to 3 expansion cohorts, one for DLBCL, one for MCL, and one for FL.
      Each cohort will be approximately 20 patients treated at the dose determined in Part 1.

      The study will include a Screening Period (of up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (cycles of
      3, 6' and 4 weeks), and a Follow-up Period (approximately every 12 week visits for up to 2
      years after treatment discontinuation).

                  active primary immunodeficiency

         21. Any other significant medical illness, abnormality, or condition that would, in the
             Investigator's judgement, make the patient inappropriate for study participation or
             put the patient at risk.
