    <textblock>
      Single-arm, phase II clinical trial of patients with Extranodal Marginal Zone Lymphoma
      (EMZL). It is planned to recruit 130 patients.

      Additional patients with Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma (SMZL), up to 15, and Nodal Marginal
      Zone Lymphoma (NMZL), up to 15, will be included in the trial in order to preliminary explore
      the clinical activity and safety of the combination treatment proposed.

      The study primary endpoints will be analysed on the EMZL population. Outcome of patients with
      SMZL and NMZL will be analysed and reported separately

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Marginal zone lymphomas (MZL) represent a group of indolent B-cell lymphomas that arises from
      marginal zone B-cells in extranodal tissues, such as spleen and mucosa associated lymphoid
      tissues, and more rarely also in nodal tissues. MZL comprises 5 to 17% of all non-Hodgkin
      lymphomas (NHL) in adults. The 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) recognized three separate
      subtypes of MZL according to their primary localization, namely the:

        1. extranodal MZL (EMZL) of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), also known as MALT
           lymphoma

        2. splenic MZL (SMZL)

        3. nodal MZL (NMZL). These three subtypes are distinct disease entities that are classified
           together because they all seem to originate from post germinal centre marginal zone
           B-cells.

      MALIBU trial is a prospective multicenter trial combining rituximab and ibrutinib in
      front-line for patients with MZL, including EMZL, SMZL and NMZL Aim of the study is to assess
      the safety and efficacy of the combination of rituximab and ibrutinib in EMZL patients and to
      explore its activity in SMZL and NMZL as exploratory subset.
