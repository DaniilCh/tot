  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Arginine methylation mediated by protein arginine methyl-transferases (PRMTs) is an important
      post-translational modification of proteins involved in a diverse range of cellular
      processes. Misregulation and overexpression of PRMT1 (a type I PRMT) has been associated with
      a number of solid and hematopoietic cancers. GSK3368715 leads to inhibition of tumor cell
      growth across tumor types with cytotoxic response observed in lymphoma, acute myeloid
      leukemia (AML) and a subset of solid tumor cell lines. This study will assess the safety,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary clinical activity of
      GSK33368715 in subjects with relapsed/refractory DLBCL and selected solid tumors with
      frequent methyl-thioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP)-deficiency. The study will consist of two
      parts. In Part 1 (Dose Escalation) escalating doses of GSK3368715 will be evaluated and
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be established in subjects with selected solid
      relapsed/refractory tumors. In Part 2 (Dose Expansion), this RP2D will be further
      investigated in two expansion cohorts; subjects with DLBCL (Expansion Cohort 2A) and
      relapsed/refractory solid tumors including pancreatic, bladder, and non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC)(Expansion Cohort 2B). The study includes a screening period, an intervention
      period and follow up. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in Part 1 and 141 will be
      enrolled in Part 2.

             diagnosis to study entry.

          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding,
             and at least one of the following conditions applies; is not a woman of childbearing
             potential (WOCBP) or is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly
             effective, with a failure rate of &lt;1 percent, during the intervention period and for
             at least 120 days, corresponding to the time needed to eliminate any study
             intervention(s) (example given [e.g.], 5 terminal half-lives) after the last dose of
             study intervention. The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the
             contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention. A WOCBP
             must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine as required by local
             regulations) within 7 days before the first dose of study intervention. The
             investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history, and
             recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early
             undetected pregnancy. Male subjects are eligible to participate if they agree to the
             following during the intervention period and for at least 100 days, corresponding to
             time needed to eliminate study intervention(s) (e.g., 5 terminal half-lives) plus 90
             days after the last dose of study intervention: Refrain from donating sperm plus
             either: Be abstinent from heterosexual or homosexual intercourse as their preferred
             and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to
             remain abstinent or must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below; agree
             to use a male condom and should also be advised of the benefit for a female partner to
             use a highly effective method of contraception as a condom may break or leak when
             having sexual intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential who is not currently
             pregnant; agree to use male condom when engaging in any activity that allows for
             passage of ejaculate to another person.
