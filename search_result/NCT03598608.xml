  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of MK-4280 in combination with pembrolizumab
      (MK-3475) in participants with hematological malignancies:

        -  classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL)

        -  diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)

        -  indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL) The study will have 2 phases: a safety lead-in and
           an efficacy expansion phase. The recommended Phase 2 dose (RPTD) will be determined in
           the safety lead-in phase by evaluating dose-limiting toxicities.
