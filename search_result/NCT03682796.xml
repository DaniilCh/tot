        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Age â‰¥ 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent.

          -  Histologically confirmed (2016 WHO lymphoma classification) B-cell NHL that is DLBCL,
             FL (including transformed FL), MZL, or MCL.

          -  Relapsed and/or refractory NHL requiring systemic therapy and have failed, are
             intolerant to, or are considered ineligible for standard of care anticancer treatments
             that are known to be potentially curative. Subjects must not be current candidates for
             HSCT. Participants who refuse standard treatments may also be considered provided that
             documentation is provided that the subject has been made aware of all therapeutic
             options.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status 0-2.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Presence of a leukemic phase of the lymphoma.

          -  &quot;Double hit&quot; or &quot;triple hit&quot; germinal center B cell lymphoma

          -  Previous solid organ allograft (except for corneal transplant) or allogeneic
             bone-marrow transplant.

          -  Peripheral neuropathy &gt; NCI-CTCAE Grade 1.

          -  Significant organ dysfunction that would preclude study participation.

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease such as uncontrolled or symptomatic arrhythmias

          -  Any other serious active disease or co-morbid medical condition, according to the
             Investigator's decision or Medical Monitor, that will substantially increase the risk
             associated with the subject's participation in the study.
