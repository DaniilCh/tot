      This is a multi-center, phase 2A exploratory study of feasibility and effectiveness of
      Inotuzumab Ozagomicin in adult patients with Acute Lymphoid Leukemia (ALL) with positive
      minimal residual disease before any hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      The study is divided in two cohorts; cohort 1 will enroll 38 Ph+ patients, cohort 2 will
      enroll 38 Ph- patients, as defined with statistical analysis. The two cohorts will have the
      same treatment, with the exception of short term and long term maintenance.
