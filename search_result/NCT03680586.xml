    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well low-dose radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage
      I-IV stomach mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Radiation therapy uses high
      energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of ultra-low dose 4 Gy gastric radiation, measured as complete
      gastric response at one year after 4 Gy treatment in patients with marginal zone lymphoma
      involving the stomach mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate distant recurrence of marginal zone lymphoma at one year. II. To evaluate
      toxicity associated with gastric radiation therapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if microbiome assessment can predict response to ultra-low dose radiation
      therapy and evaluate the differences in patient microbiome for patients who respond well and
      poorly to low dose radiation.

      II. To determine if micro-ribonucleic acid (RNA) assessment can predict response to ultra-low
      dose radiation therapy and evaluate the differences in patient microRNA profiles for patients
      who respond well and poorly to low dose radiation III. To explore the role of magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) for staging gastric MALT lymphoma and for predicting response to
      ultra-low dose radiation therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo low-dose radiation therapy over 2 fractions for 2 consecutive days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or progressive
      disease at 12-16 weeks post-treatment, or persistent disease at 1 year may undergo
      higher-dose radiation therapy at the discretion of treating physician.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1
      year.
