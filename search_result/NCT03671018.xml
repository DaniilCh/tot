    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of
      mosunetuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin in participants with B-cell non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma (NHL). It will consist of a dose finding portion and two randomized cohorts for
      participants with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or follicular
      lymphoma (FL).
