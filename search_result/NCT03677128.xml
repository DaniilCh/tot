  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital case management systems have the potential to increase compliance with
      protocol-driven treatment, reduce treatment abandonment and ultimately help to close the
      discrepancy in pediatric cancer outcomes between LMICs and high-income countries (HICs). The
      investigators aim to adapt an open-source digital case management platform to incorporate
      standardized pediatric oncology protocols. Efficacy will be evaluated by provider protocol
      compliance and patient treatment abandonment rates as compared to historic controls. The
      study population will include 50 consecutive patients diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma or
      retinoblastoma at Bugando Medical Centre in Tanzania.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 220,000 children globally are newly diagnosed with cancer. Over 85%
      of these new diagnoses are made in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Survival rates
      in LMICs are 5-25% compared to 80% in high-income countries (HICs). One of the primary
      contributors to the discrepancy in survival outcomes between LMICs and HICs is a high rate of
      treatment abandonment, defined as refusal to initiate or failure to complete curative
      treatment. Treatment abandonment rate in Tanzania is higher than in other LMICs (40% compared
      to 10-25%), directly impacting patient survival. In HICs, protocol-driven treatment for
      children with cancer has led to increased treatment compliance and large improvements in
      survival. However, it is often not feasible or appropriate to use protocol-driven treatment
      in LMICs without necessary supportive care, human resources and infrastructure. Not
      surprisingly, protocol-related compliance is lower in LMICs compared to HICs. Mobile
      technologies for health (i.e., mHealth) can facilitate implementation of and compliance with
      standardized pediatric oncology protocols through step-by-step decision support algorithms,
      reminders and alerts related to patient visits, and timely data for health service
      coordination with allied health providers (e.g., nurses, pharmacists etc.). This
      multidisciplinary team from Duke University and Dimagi Inc. in USA, and Bugando Medical
      Center (BMC) in Tanzania, proposes to adapt, implement, and evaluate an mHealth case
      management system at BMC to improve health provider compliance with standardized pediatric
      oncology protocols.

      For Aim 1, the proposed mHealth case management system will initially focus on developing the
      two nationally-approved protocols for Burkitt lymphoma and retinoblastoma. Using principles
      of persuasive system design and CFIR, prompts that guide users through protocol
      implementation will be used as behavioral triggers to assist with perceived ease of use.
      Implementation evaluation will include measurement of baseline technology acceptance and
      Organizational Readiness for Implementing Change (ORIC).

      For Aim 2, Oncology providers at BMC will receive training on using the mHealth case
      management system as part of a 2-day in country workshop led by the M-PIs. This training will
      be followed by 1 week of supported implementation. Following this training period, the case
      management system will be used to enroll pediatric patients at BMC with pre-clinical
      diagnosis of BL or Rb, over a period of 1 year and manage their care for the duration of
      treatment (up to 3 months for BL and 4 months for Rb). BMC receives and treats approximately
      150 patients every year, with an estimated 50 patients with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and Rb. To
      review historic compliance, 50 consecutive files of patients diagnosed after 2015 with BL and
      Rb (when protocols were introduced) will be abstracted by a trained research assistant.
      Compliance with mHealth implementation will be monitored continuously by the mHealth system
      using the same criteria. System functionality will be assessed continuously. Semi-structured
      assessments of provider system acceptance and usability will be assessed at the end of
      follow-up.
