    <description>In this study, PBCAR0191, allogeneic anti-CD19 CAR T Cells, is used to treat patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma and r/r B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia.
Route of Administration: Intravenous infusion.
Lymphodepletion Conditioning: Lymphodepletion will be conducted several days prior to PBCAR0191 infusion. A combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide will be used for lymphodepletion.</description>
