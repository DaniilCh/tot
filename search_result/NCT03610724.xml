  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in children
      and adolescents with relapsed/refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL). For
      pediatric patients who have r/r B-NHL, survival rates are dismal, only ~20-50% subjects are
      alive at 2 years with overall response rate (ORR) of 20-30% after conventional salvage
      chemotherapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is part of an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP). The single-arm study
      design includes r/r B-cell NHL subject population with poor prognosis, lack of approved
      effective therapies in this setting. Subject population will include aggressive subtypes of
      B-cell NHL and will be allowed to receive &quot;bridging therapy&quot; of investigator's choice After
      assessment of eligibility, subjects qualifying for the study will be enrolled and are allowed
      to start lymphodepleting chemotherapy as recommended in protocol after which a single dose of
      tisagenlecleucel product will be infused. The efficacy of tisagenlecleucel will be evaluated
      through the primary endpoint of Overall Response Rate (ORR) which includes complete response
      (CR) and partial response (PR) as determined by local assessment. Safety assessments will be
      conducted through the study completion.
